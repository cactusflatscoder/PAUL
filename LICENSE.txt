<h3>Definition of Marginalization:</h3>
<p>
  For the purposes of this license, <strong>"Marginalized Individuals or Groups"</strong> are those who experience systemic barriers to access, representation, or safety due to factors such as race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, religion, immigration status, or socioeconomic background. This definition is grounded in historical and ongoing patterns of exclusion, not in perceived social disagreement or opposition to discriminatory beliefs.
